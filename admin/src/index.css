  Global styles for the EPS admin panel.  Tailwind's preflight resets
  most defaults, so only minimal overrides are required here.  We also
  define a dark mode background and text colour when the `dark` class
  is present on the html element (set by top-level layout based on
  user preference in the future).  Additional CSS can be placed here
  or in individual component files if needed.
