API endpoints for scheduled tasks.

These routes allow administrator clients and bots to poll the system
for tasks that need to be executed.  A task may correspond to a
scheduled mailing that is ready to be sent or an open support ticket
that requires a response.  Clients should call this endpoint
periodically to discover new work items instead of exposing a reverse
callback interface.

    Bots should poll this endpoint regularly (e.g. every minute) to discover
    new work items.  Each task corresponds to a scheduled action (currently
    mailings) and is created separately for each messenger.  When a bot
    completes a task, it must call the completion endpoint with the task's
    ID so that the task is not returned again.  Only administrators and
    bots with an administrator role can access tasks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    messenger : str
        Short code of the messenger requesting tasks (e.g. ``telegram``,
        ``vk``, ``max``).  Tasks for other messengers are not returned.
    until : Optional[str]

        If omitted, the current server time is used.

    -------
    List[TaskRead]
        A list of pending tasks for the given messenger.
