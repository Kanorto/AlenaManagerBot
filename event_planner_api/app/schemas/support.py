"""
Pydantic schemas for support tickets and messages.

These schemas define the request and response bodies for the support
module.  A ticket groups one or more messages exchanged between a
user and support staff.  Each message records who sent it and when.

Fields that are returned from the database (e.g. timestamps) are
represented as ``str`` because SQLite returns ISO timestamp strings.
In a more advanced implementation you might convert these to
``datetime`` objects.
