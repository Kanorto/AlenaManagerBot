"""
Main entrypoint for the Event Planner API.

This module assembles the FastAPI application, sets up logging and
includes versioned routers.  The ``create_app`` function builds
and configures the app, which is then instantiated at module
import time as ``app``.  Importing the app here makes it easy to
run with uvicorn or another ASGI server, e.g.::

    uvicorn event_planner_api.app.main:app --reload

The application title and version are provided via ``Settings`` from
``core.config``.
